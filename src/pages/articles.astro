    <h1>Articles by Other Authors</h1>
    <p>
        Below is a link to my library of articles that I've read and kept. All manner of content is referenced here.
        From things like technical deep dives of compiler architecture to project management strategies. If I feel that
        it could be useful it's here.
    </p>
