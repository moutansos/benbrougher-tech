  <h2>Hardware</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      For my personal laptop, I use a <a
        href="https://frame.work/"
        target="_blank">Framework 13 with the AMD Ryzen 7840U</a
      >. It's loaded up with a 512 GB  SSD and 32GB of RAM.

      My work laptop is a Dell Precision 5530 with a 512 GB SSD, and 32 GB of
      RAM.
    </li>
    <li>
      My desktop is a custom PC in a Corsair Carbide case, with an <a

        >PNY XLR8 RTX 2080 Ti</a
      >, 32 GB of RAM and a 1 TB SSD. I also threw an old Gigabyte GTX 1060 in
      there to accelerate video editing and for machine learning workloads.
    </li>
    <li>
      My phone is a <a href="https://amzn.to/48m78O4" target="_blank"
        >Pixel 7 Pro</a
      >.
    </li>
    <li>
      I have an old server as well that I use to host some VMs and experiment.
      It's a Dell PowerEdge R710, loaded up with 10 TB of SAS drives and 128 GB
      of RAM.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Software</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      For operating systems, I use Windows 11 on my desktop and I use Ubuntu
      24.10 on my laptop. On my servers I tend to run the latest LTS edition of
      Ubuntu Server.
    </li>
    <li>
      I run a Kubernetes cluster, specifically the microk8s distribution on some
      VMs for testing and tinkering.
    </li>
    <li>
      My programming languages of choice are TypeScript for frontend and C#/.NET
      Core for backend (although I've been using Go and HTMX more lately). I
      also know JavaScript, Golang and PowerShell and have some experience with
      Rust, Java, Python, Bash, and C/C++.
    </li>
    <li>
      As far as frontend frameworks go, my favorite is Svelte, but I also do a
      lot of work in Vue 3. I've played around with React and Angular but just
      haven't gravitated twoards them.

    <li>My main IDE for web development and most anything else is Neovim.</li>
    <li>To manage my music and shows, I use <a href="https://plex.tv">Plex</a>.</li>

      instance on my server to manage my smart home things.
    </li>
    <li>For keeping all my files in sync and backed up, I use Resilo Sync.</li>
