    <h1>Uses</h1>
    <div class="subtitle">The tech I use day in and day out</div>
    <p>
        Inspired by Wes Bos and his <a href="https://uses.tech" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">uses.tech</a>
        project. It's all the tech and software I use at work and play.
    </p>
    <h2>Hardware</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>For my personal laptop, I use a <a href="https://amzn.to/3cTq0vX" target="_blank">Dell Latitude E5570</a>. It's loaded up with a 1TB SSD and 16GB of RAM.</li>
        <li>My work laptop is a Dell Presision 5530 with a 512 GB SSD, and 32 GB of RAM.</li>
        <li>
            My desktop is a custom PC in a Corsair Carbide case, with an <a href="https://amzn.to/3bos6nf" target="_blank">Ryzen 9 3950x</a>, an <a href="https://amzn.to/3bg0KzU" target="_blank">PNY XLR8 RTX 2080 Ti</a>,
            32 GB of RAM and a 1 TB SSD. I also threw an old Gigabyte GTX 1060 in there to accelerate
            video editing and for machine learning workloads.
        </li>
        <li>My phone is a <a href="https://amzn.to/3BuzacA" target="_blank">Pixel 4 XL</a>, usually running the latest beta version of Android.</li>
        <li>
            I have an old server as well that I use to host some VMs and experiment. It's a Dell PowerEdge R710, loaded
            up with 10 TB of SAS drives and 48 GB of RAM.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Software</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            For operatings systems, I use Windows 11 on my desktop and I use Ubuntu 22.04 on my laptop. On my
            servers I tend to run the latest LTS edition of Ubuntu Server.
        </li>
        <li>
            I run a Kubernetes cluster, specifically the microk8s distribution on some VMs and old laptops for 
            testing and tinkering.
        </li>
        <li>
            My programming languages of choice are TypeScript for frontend and C#/.NET Core for backend.
            I also know JavaScirpt, Golang and PowerShell and have some experience with Java, Python,
            Bash, and C/C++.
        </li>
        <li>
            As far as frontend frameworks go, my favorite is Svelte, but I also do a lot of work in
            Vue 3. I've played around with React and Angular but just haven't gravitated twoards them.
        </li>
        <li>
            My main IDE for web development and most anything else is VS Code. My IDE for C#/.NET Core
            is Visual Studio 2022.
        </li>
        <li>To manage my music and shows, I use Plex.</li>
        <li>I run a Home Assistant instance on my server to manage my smart home things.</li>
        <li>For keeping all my files in sync and backed up, I use Resilo Sync.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Desk Setup</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>My desk is a cheap 47" Tresanti standing desk from Costco.</li>
        <li>For a chair I use a Autonomus MayoChair.</li>
        <li>My keyboard is a <a href="https://amzn.to/3OHkwlf" target="_blank">Logitech G512 Carbon</a> with GX Brown switches.</li>
        <li>I use a <a href="https://amzn.to/3BuIk9g" target="_blank">Logitech G502 Hero</a> Mouse.</li>
